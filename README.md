"# huawei-mifi-auto-script-tampermonkey" 

Purpose:
my bad signal from telecom operator cause me to repeatedly reset the network as to increase network speed by resetting, this script is helping me to prevent the fatigue of doing that

script used to add: 
- network speed smalll widget
- button autologin, for not getting tired always keying the user and passwprd
- button for resetting network by auto switch network from initially 4g to 3g then to 4g again, sometimes it does increse the GSM signal in my location
* there is an autologin feature inside the script, if url ws detected at location home (indexOf('html/home')) then the script will press the first custom button to autologin with defined user pass inside script, then redirect to networksetting page
